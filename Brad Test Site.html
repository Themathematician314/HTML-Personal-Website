            <p>My name is Bradley Soo, but you can just call me Brad, like Brad Pitt (His name's <a href="https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt">William Bradley Pitt</a>) or Bradley Cooper. Anyways, welcome to my website.
        I don't really know what I'm doing here. I post what I think is interesting here. </p>
            <h3> About Me.</h3>
            <p>I graduated the City College of New York with a B.A. in Mathematics Edcuation Degree, however, because I didn't complete the NYC's teaching exam, the EdTPA and the ALST exam, I ultimately decided to
        try to find a career in cybersecurity, or get into being a private school teacher. (Whichever comes first).
        At the moment; I play <a href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US">League of Legends</a>, and I'm learning cybersecurity through Wikipedia and through different textbooks. Ultimately, I have four goals in life in 
        no particular order. I just wanted to make a list object.
            <ul>
                <li> Learn Japanese and Chinese. (The spoken language I have no problems with, but writing it is a problem). </li>
                <li> Work as a cryptographer for Google, Facebook or some rogue company that really wants a mathematician.</li>
                <li> Fall in love in something (too bad, I fell in love with cryptography, so no women, men and whatever the new human evolution form is).</li>
                <li> Hang out with friends and meet new people (This is extremely hard.). </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Questions and Answers about this Poorly Constructed Site:</h2>
            <h3> So what's the point in this site anyways?</h3>
            <p>
        To test my skills as a web developer and try to break <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256/AES-512 Encryption</a></strong> without really trying too hard. Also, I want to use this to 
        try to learn more about web development, and back-end development. Other than that, nothing much really. The list below shows what I am currently working on.
                <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <a href="https://github.com/Themathematician314">Learning cybersecurity through Python modules</a>.</li>
                        <li> Crypography and using Python to create Encryption Schemes. </li>
                        <li> <a href="#">This website.</a> </li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>What type of music do you listen to? </h3>
            <p>I have my playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sghp_nQ93xg&list=PL_93wHH7Hw-tor4QAqQEHTQt00gg5zNFs">here</a>. Most if not all of the music that I listen to is Japanese and some Chinese music.
            It's not like I hate American music, but I mostly listen to Eminem songs that have meaning. Other than that, most of modern rap is like 4/10 at best. I really just like Japanese and Vocaloid music in general.
